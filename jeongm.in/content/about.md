Hello! My name is Jeong Min Lim, and I'm a BS+MS student at Washington University in St. Louis. I just completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science this May. 

I'm very passionate about full-stack development and cybersecurity, and I am currently looking for a fulltime opportunity in software engineering. 

In my free time, I enjoy learning new technology and building mini projects.
